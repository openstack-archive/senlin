        <param_1>: <value_1>
        <param_2>: <value_2>
        ...
      }

    The ``<action_name>`` indicates the requested action while the ``<param>``

  type: integer
  in: body
  description: |
    The value to be set as the new ``min_size`` of the cluster.

adjustment_min_step:
  type: integer
  in: body
  description: |
    When ``adjustment_type`` is set to ``CHANGE_IN_PERCENTAGE``, often times
    the computed value is a float which could be less than 1.0. The
    ``min_step`` can be used to specify that at least this number of nodes will
    be added or removed.

adjustment_number:
  type: number
  in: body
  description: |
    The number of adjustment. The interpretion of the value depends on the
    value of the ``adjustment_type`` parameter. This parameter is mandatory
    when ``adjustment_type`` is specified. Otherwise, it is optional.

    When ``adjustment_type`` is specified as ``CHANGE_IN_PERCENTAGE``, the
    value of this parameter can be a float number, otherwise it has to be an
    integer.

adjustment_strict:
  type: bool
  in: body
  default: False
  description: |
    There are cases where the computed number of nodes to adjust will break
    the size constraints of a cluster, i.e. its ``min_size`` or ``max_size``
    property. If this is the case, the ``strict`` parameter can further
    instructs the senlin engine whether the resize should be done on a best
    effort basis. If the value is set to True, senlin engine will perform the
    resize operation while respecting the cluster's size constraints.
    Otherwise, if the computed adjustment will break the size constraints, the
    resize request will be directly rejected.

adjustment_type:
  type: string
  in: body
  description: |
    The type of size adjustment. The valid values are:

    - ``EXACT_CAPACITY``: The adjustment number specified is to be interpreted
      as the targeted ``desired_capacity``. This value has to be a non-negative
      integer.
    - ``CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY``: The adjustment number specified is to be treated
      as the number of nodes to add or remove. The value has to be a non-zero
      integer. A positive number can be used to specify the number of nodes to
      add while a negative number can be specified to indicate the number of
      nodes to remove.
    - ``CHANGE_IN_PERCENTAGE``: The adjustment number will be interpreted as
      a percentile relative to a cluster's current ``desired_capacity``. The
      adjustment number can be a positive or negative float value.

    This parameter is optional when a resize request is only about changing the
    ``min_size`` and/or ``max_size`` of the cluster. Otherwise, it is required.
    When this paramter is specified, the ``number`` parameter has to be
    provided as well.
