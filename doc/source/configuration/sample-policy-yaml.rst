.. warning::

   JSON formatted policy file is deprecated since Senlin 11.0.0 (Wallaby).
   This `oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml`__ tool will migrate your existing
   JSON-formatted policy file to YAML in a backward-compatible way.

.. __: https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/cli/oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml.html

Use the ``policy.yaml`` file to define additional access controls that will be
applied to Senlin:

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/senlin.policy.yaml.sample
