    Excluding CLUSTER_RESIZE from the list of actions that skip pre-op checks
    if the cluster is already at the minimum threshold. When the cluster is at
    the minimum threshold, pre-operation LB will function with actions such as
    CLUSTER_DEL_NODES, CLUSTER_SCALE_IN, NODE_DELETE, and will skip actions
    like CLUSTER_REPLACE_NODES and CLUSTER_RESIZE.
